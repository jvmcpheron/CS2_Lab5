# CS2_Lab5

## Introduction
In class, I discussed the efficiency of a BagADT implementation using arrays but keeping the arrays in sorted order.  I did not show you the code for that, but it should be pretty straightforward. 

## What to Do
I would like you to implement the Bag using a sorted array of strings starting with my code and updating those routines that need to be changed.  You can find the .h file from my code here Download hereand the .cpp file here Download here.

Once you have done that, I would like you to use the ideas we looked at in HW 5 to do timing tests of the routines you had to change.  You should do tests with the old BagADT and your new BagADT on all of the routines that changed and try to see if the results make sense.

## What To Turn In
Submit your solution as a CPP file with your first and last name included in the file as a comment.  Include a long comment showing the results of your tests of how fast the code is.
